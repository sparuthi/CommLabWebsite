# CommLabWebsite

Description: 
Create a web page to house and debut your 30MFF. Think about how you want to "brand" the film. 

Project: 
My project website which I like to call as "Honest Review: Zoom" gives an honest review about the application "Zoom" as the name describes it. The website gives a jist about what our website is about through the theme of honest website. 

Process: 
I start with the colour theme of the website which in blue and grey/white, similar to that of the Zoom application. We can see an honest welcome message that usually no one reads in a website. Right next to the honest welcome message is a picture of clearly guiding about what this website is actually about. Then as you sccroll down you can see the "What you will find here" box along with number of subcribers and engagement rate box, just like any other similar website. The "What you wll find here box" is a cliche touch to the big words that people use to give a sense of what the website is about is any similar websites. It is like a parody on the similar websites.
The about us tab is a page describing our team and how we ironically completed the movie in 45 minutes using zoom. 
The last tab is "Zoom: the movie", shows the movie made by our team. Using javascript I created interaction between the user and the website with respect to viewing the movie. I created a variable for the movie and using the function command gave different dimensions to the width of the video for each button: big, small, normal(default) and play/pause. 

Challenges: 
Initially I had more interactive plans with the customer, such as an inbuilt contact form and subscription, however due to lack in time to understand javascript, I could not figure those elements out. Overall, I believe I did get my visual into action. Also, the positioning factor was kind of chllenging to understand at first since I have never used html before and I think I outdid myself. I believe that this website gave me a better understanding of coding and helped me learn potentially the basics in a great way
